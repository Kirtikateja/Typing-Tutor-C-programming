I built this project after completing the fundamentals of the C programming language. The project, titled "Typing Tutor", is a console-based C application focused on measuring and improving typing performance. It served as a hands-on opportunity to apply core programming concepts such as file handling, loops, conditional statements, string operations, and time-based calculations in a structured and practical manner. The application provides two practice modes (Easy and Difficult), retrieves text from external files (easy.txt / difficult.txt), evaluates user input character-by-character in real time, and generates detailed performance insights.

The program evaluates:
a. Accuracy (%)
b. Typing Speed (Words Per Minute)
c. Number of Mistakes
d. Total Time Taken

It also enables users to store and access their performance reports in a progress.txt file, allowing them to monitor improvement over multiple attempts.

Skills: C (Programming Language), File Management, Logical Thinking, Console Application Development
